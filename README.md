**Abstract**: The developing mammary gland engages a myriad of transcriptionally intensive networks purposed to support cellular differentiation pathways arising from stem-like and progenitors cells. Influenced by hormonal cues and organized in a hierarchical manner, the heterogeneity of cell populations that exist through lineage commitment becomes extensive. The magnitude of this circumstance suggests the need for a deeper understanding of cell population transition, which include scattered intermediates and divergences. Moreover, there is a present need to establish a comprehensive foundation of gene expression signatures to discern cell characterizations from each other in precise manor. Utilizing single cell RNA sequencing, we implemented the already existing transcriptional portfolio of the developing mammary gland in order to improve the classification of epithelial and immune resident mammary gland populations. Consequently, this work provides a firmer platform for mammary cellular lineage definition, and approach that may improve the identification of relevant clones into progressions toward tumorigenesis.
